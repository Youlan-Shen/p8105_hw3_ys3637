## Problem 1

This problem uses the Instacart data. DO NOT include this dataset in
your local data directory; instead, load the data from the
p8105.datasets using:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 2

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
observation periods, the devices measure “activity counts” in a short
period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be
worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be downloaded here. In this
spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for each
minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

### Read in, tidy, and describe the data

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
# read in data from CSV file
accel_data <- read_csv("data/accel_data.csv")

This dataset contains 50400 rows and 6 columns, while each row showing
an activity measure in a single minute during the 5-week data collection
period. Variables include week (from the first week to the fifth week),
day_id(from the first day to the 35th day), day_type (from Monday to
Sunday), minute (every minute in a single day), activity_counts (the
counts that is recorded in the accelerometer), and weekday_vs_weekend
(which distinguish weekdays and weekend). There are total 50400
observations, which are the activity measures from every minute in a day
during the 5-week period.
